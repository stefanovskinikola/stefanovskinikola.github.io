## Project Overview

**Galactic Ledger** is a browser-based banking simulation for interstellar accounts.

- Most of the code was generated by AI.
- Human fine-tuning was applied to ensure quality and proper functionality.

## Setup & Usage

- Open `index.html` using a **local server**.
- Browsers block ES modules on `file://`, so you need a server. Options:
  - VS Code Live Server extension
  - Python: `python -m http.server`
  - Node: `npx serve`
- Once opened, use the prompts to interact with the banking terminal.
