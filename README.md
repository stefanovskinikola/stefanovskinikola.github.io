It is intended as a visual and interactive representation of the table for learning and reference.

## 🧑‍💻 No AI Used in Development

All HTML, CSS, color choices, layout decisions, and content structure for this website were created manually.  
Artificial Intelligence tools were **not** used in the making of the webpage itself.

AI assistance was used **only** for general questions and troubleshooting during development,  
but **not** for generating the website’s structure, design, or content.

## 📚 Source of Information

All elemental data (names, symbols, atomic numbers) and category classifications come from:
