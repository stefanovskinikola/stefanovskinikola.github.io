# Nikola Stefanovski - Web Developer Portfolio

A minimalistic, interactive personal portfolio built to showcase my web development projects, technical skills, and experience. This project was developed as a homework assignment for the Web Development Academy, with a strong focus on clean architecture, robust User Experience (UX), and custom Vanilla JavaScript logic, all wrapped in a fully responsive design.
